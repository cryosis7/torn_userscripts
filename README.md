## Userscripts:
### Clean Travel Screen
This script will clear away most of the clutter on the travel screen and is useful for when you are in a public space(like work) and want to look a little more inconspicuous while having Torn open.

I made this out of fustration, after spending 1000E in the gym out of habbit from training, when I was saving for a chain.
